Welcome!
======
As a senior majoring in Math and Statistics at UW-Madison, I am passionate about applying my quantitative and analytical skills to solve real-world problems. I have earned multiple Dean's List honors for my academic excellence and received a BLS certification for my healthcare interests.

I have gained valuable work experience in both banking and research settings. As an Assistant Account Manager at China CITIC Bank, I supported the team in managing client relationships, conducting market research, and preparing reports. As a Student Lab Support at Burkard Lab, I learned general lab techniques and assisted in lab maintenance and organization. I have some experience in Python, R, and Java, and have used them for data analysis and programming projects. I am eager to learn more and explore new opportunities in the fields of math, statistics, and data science.
