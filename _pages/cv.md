## Education
======
* B.S. Mathematics & Statistics, University of Wisconsin-Madison (In progress), 2024

## Research & Academic Projects
======
* **Gender and Racial/Ethnic Disparities of Early-onset Colorectal Cancer by Anatomical Sites, Histological Types, and Disease Stages in the United States during 2001-2019**  
  * Research Assistant supervised by Shihua Wang from Ohio State University  
  * Extracted and prepared data from SEER*Stat for analysis, with a focus on early-onset colorectal cancer  
  * Conducted preliminary statistical calculations, including mean and variance, to understand data distributions  
  * Developed graphics to detect critical patterns and trends  
  * Utilized SAS software for statistical analysis, evaluating data using p-values  
  * Helped identify crucial areas for further research and discussion in thesis development  

* **Regression Model Design for Human Bodyfat Prediction**  
  * Group Project supervised by Prof. Hyunseung Kang  
  * Imported dataset into RStudio and detected outliers using Cookâ€™s distance, leverage point, and IQR analysis  
  * Assessed dataset normality, homoskedasticity, and linearity using QQ plot and residual plot  
  * Explored regression models including Simple Linear Regression (SLR) and Multiple Linear Regressions (MLRs)  
  * Achieved a high-performing final model with an R-square exceeding 0.7 and RMSE of 4.08

* **Numerical Study of Kakeya Maximal Inequalities**  
  * Research Project supervised by Prof. Terrence Harris and Graduate Student Kaiyi Huang  
  * Conducted an in-depth review of the Kakeya maximal function conjecture  
  * Designed and implemented numerical simulations for 3D tubes using spatial hashing techniques  
  * Developed strategies to test the conjecture's robustness, employing optimization algorithms  
  * Utilized MATLAB and Python libraries for complex geometric computations  

* **Stars and Planets Data Analysis**  
  * Group Project  
  * Used Python and Jupyter Notebook to process data and handle missing values  
  * Created graphs for data visualization and analysis of astronomical data  
  * Applied astrophysical formulas to identify habitable planets  

* **Wordle Game**  
  * Individual Project  
  * Developed a beginner-level Wordle game using Java in IntelliJ  
  * Implemented error-handling mechanisms and used ArrayList management
